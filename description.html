    <div class="jesuscontent1">Jesus as the Messiah
        Messiah is a Hebrew word meaning ‘anointed one’. Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah because through his crucifixion and resurrection he brought salvation to humankind.</div>
    <div class="jesuscontent2">Jesus as the Son of God
        Most Christians believe that Jesus, as well as being fully human, is also fully God. Most Christians believe that Jesus is the second person of the Holy Trinity and is the Son of God.</div>
        <div class="jesuscontent3">Jesus as a lord and saviour
            ‘Lord’ is a term of respect used when referring to a male ruler with power and authority over others. The Gospel of Matthew states that Jesus is ‘Lord’ and has all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18)
